# [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)

I've done that year's (2024) challenges for fun and to practice with Rust (which I'd been learning at that moment in
time) language without deep performance optimization since I prefer idiomatic and readable code until it really needs to
be much faster, so most solutions are quick enough to do a job in seconds under debug build configuration.

### Rules:

- `Rust`
- `Built-in only`
- Try to use as much declarative style as I can :)
- Consistently formatted with `rustfmt` and linted by `clippy` via [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/index.html)
